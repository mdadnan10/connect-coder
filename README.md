CONNECT CODER

The main objective of Connect Coder app is to help coders to communicate and share their thoughts with the coding community, 
gain knowledge and share trending technologies. We are developing this project because now if we have any problem or question 
or any suggestion, we have to search on the internet, if we donâ€™t find any solution, then we ask people who may know, this application
will help a lot of coders to share, ask and resolve their problem at earliest possible. This project is developed using the Iterative 
waterfall model. Hardware used is Android mobile with version 7.0 and above, 2GB of ram and 8GB minimum of storage, and tools are Java, 
Kotlin, XML, Firebase, and SQLite. We used unit testing to test all activities and design. This project will help many coders to share and 
communicate with each other without any additional cost.
                     This app is like a social media platform where a user needs to register and then log in, after logging in they can create
 a post, share their codes, thoughts, and direct message anyone with their questions and queries, and get answered, also they can search users 
 using name or technologies they want to know about also there is a section code hub where they can upload their code in any format like pdf, image,
 text, word, zip, and users can download and respond, user can also like and comment in any post they want, this app consists of only one module, 
 which is the user side. User can also update their relevant technologies and manage their profile on the profile page.
